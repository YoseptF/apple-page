## HTML Forms Project  - Apple landing page 2014

4nd Microverse Project (solo), part of the HTML and CSS course

Our goal is to replicate the apple home page from 2014.

I tried to use JS and JQuery into the project but since I don't know how it works I did not now how to make it perfect. The size of the middle images (the four link ones) will be in a perfect ratio if you leave the page as you open it. If you try to move it, it will not respond. 

# Tools

Stylelint for CSS and W3C Markup Validator for HTML.

# Requirements

*** Although it has input fields, nothing works since we didnt use javascript in this project.

Replicate the page using flex or float.

Use gradients.
